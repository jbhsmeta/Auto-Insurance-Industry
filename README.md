# Auto-Insurance-Industry
This model is created using machine learning concepts to predict the customers who are most likely to come back for claim next year.
Machine Learning model that were used are Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, Xgboost and Adaboost. 
The performance of the above model was also validated by combining Logistic Regression, Xgboost and Adaboost using F1 Score

# Motivation
The model shall mainly support the following use cases:
1. Conquering Market Share: Capture market share by lowering the prices of the premium for the customers, who are least likely to claim.
2. Risk Management: Charge the right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim insurance in the coming year
3. Smooth Processing: Reduce the complexity of pricing models. Most of the transactions are happening online with larger customer attributes (thanks to the internet and social media). Harness the power of huge data to build complex ML models
4. Increased Profits: As per industry estimate 1% reduction in the claim can boost profit by 10%. So, through the ML model, we can identify and deny the insurance to the driver who will make a claim. Thus, ensuring reduced claim outgo and increased profit.
